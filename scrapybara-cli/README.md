Based on the search results, "Deez Nuts" has two main notable meanings:

1. As a Political Satire:
- "Deez Nuts" was a satirical presidential candidate portrayed by Brady C. Olson who ran for president of the United States in 2016
- Olson was 15 years old at the time and filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on July 26, 2015
- He was a resident of Wallingford, Iowa

2. As a Slang Term/Joke:
- "Deez nuts" (or "deez nutz") is a slang term and euphemism for "testicles"
- It's also known as the punchline of a setup joke that involves asking someone a vague question to solicit a follow-up question, before yelling out the phrase in an obnoxious manner
- The phrase gained popularity as a joke and internet meme, particularly after the satirical presidential campaign

The term has become a well-known part of internet and popular culture, combining both its use as a juvenile joke and its later adoption as a satirical political statement.

Would you like me to provide more specific information about either the satirical campaign or the phrase's origins as a joke?
